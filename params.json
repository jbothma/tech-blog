{"name":"Tech-blog","tagline":"","body":"### Tech blog: real world example platform comparison\r\nThis series aims to provide idiomatic examples of how to deal with important aspects of systems found in the real world. The idea is to demonstrate how different frameworks support or struggle to solve these problems. Obviously input is very welcome to show each framework in its best light, to provide a fair comparison of these frameworks and show where each framework shines or perhaps isn't the best tool for the job.\r\n\r\n* Suggestions of problems to demonstrate are welcome\r\n* Suggestions of alternative solutions or additional frameworks are welcome\r\n\r\nThis will follow an iterative development style, where one post could show a fairly naiive solution and another post could show a more mature solution.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
